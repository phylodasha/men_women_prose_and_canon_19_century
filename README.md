# men_women_prose_and_canon_19_century
This work is devoted to the study of the difference between two groups of texts - women's prose and men's one. Our goal is to find out, what signs can distinguish male from female writing without  close reading. For the research we use the corpus of Russian novellistic prose of the XIX - early XX century, which contains canonical and non-canonical female and male texts. Features such as punctuation and morphology, vocabulary and style are analyzed. The result of the work is the approval of the null hypothesis about the identity of samples for all features except vocabulary. A significant difference in dictionaries and semantic circles of keywords has been revealed. This indicates a difference in the perception and representation of reality by writers and women writers of the XIX â€“ early XX century.
